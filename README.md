#Introduction to traffic light challenge...

You are part of a team working as consultants for Transport for London on investigating the use of technology to help make improvements to the road network.

The challenge your team are faced with is to design and prototype a traffic light system to safely control the flow of traffic along a road. As an example, in the road layout shown in figure 1, roadworks along the main road mean that a temporary traffic light system must be installed, with two sets of lights located at the two points marked Z, allowing traffic to flow alternately from left-to-right and then right-to-left.

As this work is exploratory in nature, the client is interested in innovation and designs that creative responses to the problem, rather than the delivery of complete working products . So that means that an interesting idea or an unusual experiment may be just as good as a more functional but less innovative prototype.

#Our idea...

-Three sets of traffic lights [(Z),(Z),(X)], plus the lights for the pedestrian crossing[(Y),(Y)].
-7-Segment display to show the time for pedastrians to finish passing the crossing before it changes back to red.
-Simulate a photocam at the way X if the car crosses on the red light.
-Buttons to trigger a pedastrian crossing.
-The sequence of traffic lights should change on it's own.
