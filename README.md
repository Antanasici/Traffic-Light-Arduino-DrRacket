The challenge your team are faced with is to design and prototype a traffic light system to safely control the flow of traffic along a road. As an example, in the road layout shown in figure 1, roadworks along the main road mean that a temporary traffic light system must be installed, with two sets of lights located at the two points marked Z, allowing traffic to flow alternately from left-to-right and then right-to-left.

As this work is exploratory in nature, the client is interested in innovation and designs that creative responses to the problem, rather than the delivery of complete working products . So that means that an interesting idea or an unusual experiment may be just as good as a more functional but less innovative prototype.

## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```sh
npm install my-crazy-module --save
```

Windows:

```sh
edit autoexec.bat
```

## Usage example

A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
```
